# What is This ?
After joining [FusionCharts](https://www.fusioncharts.com/), I noticed that they were still using the least squares method for generating a best fit line. As data is rarely linear in real life, I decided to create a non-linear regression module for the company. Before I could start working on this, I was asked to pitch my idea by developing a prototype. This is that prototype, in which, the model selects the best-fit-line in realtime, based on the Mean Squared Error metric.
